                        Keep the mare blindfolded as much as possible and use the tightest option that still allows them to do what is required of them. eg.

                <p>
                    My name is Five. I've been active in the pony play community since 2022, and mare since about the same time, at SnR, then at Tall Tails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past few years, I've formed some opinions on how I like to be handled, and how to handle others. These are my opinions, and they are not necessarily the best or most correct, but they are my opinions.
                </p>

                    If you wish to have a chat, I'm on Discord as <span class="highlight">fivedoll</span>, or in Second Life as <span class="highlight">i.doll</span>.

                    First off, I wish to acknowledge the more general guides that have been written by others, that gave inspiration to write this one.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's start with defining what a mare is in the context of Second Life pony play and this guide. In this context, a mare is any heavily restricted pony, regardless of whether they are male or female.”
                    It is not about the physical appearance of the pony, but about the level of restriction and the level of control the trainer has over the pony.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's important to remember that there's no one size fits all for mares, mare life can be very lonely and boring at times; this boredom can be leveraged by the trainer.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="topic" id="chat">
                <h2>Chat</h2>
                <p>
                    Chat control is a big part of controlling a mare, and can be used to tease and torment the mare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mare hearing is one tool that is very effective, many stables in Second Life have tools that offer this feature, if yours doesn't, you can get <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/The-Unhearing/25135496">The Unhearing</a> by Mara Lucente, this can be integrated with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/AnaVision-Ultimate-Vision-Control-System/19593320">Anavision Rescript</a><a href="#footnote-av">1</a>, or used standalone.
                    Mare hearing captures the local chat around the mare and replaces most words with gibberish, while passing a very limited set of words a mare can understand.
                    For example; You say "pony or a mare?", what the mare hears is "pony ʵʵ ᶶ mare?". Here the words "or" and "a" are replaced with gibberish, while the words "pony" and "mare" are passed through to the mare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With mare hearing, it's ideal if you have someone else with you to chat with. This way, you reinforce that the mare isn't able to understand human speech.
                    This for some mares is very frustrating, while others, like myself, find it cathartic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IM control is another effective tool, limit who and when they can chat with others and make them focus on the task at hand, not chit-chatting with others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Start IM</strong> is the most basic form, this makes it so you can control whether or not they can start an IM session with others, and even optionally who they can and can't start the IMs with.
                    When you have a mare with this restriction and you open a chat with them, you can close their side of the chat using the command <span class="highlight">@stopim</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Send IM</strong> lets you control if they can send IMs at all even if they have an IM window open, like with Start IM, you can also control who they can optionally send IMs to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Receive IM</strong> lets you control if they can receive IMs at all, like with Start IM, you can also control who they can optionally receive IMs from.
                </p>

            <section class="topic" id="blindfold">
                <h2>Blindfold</h2>
                <p>
                    The blindfold is another very powerful tool, making sure the mare's focus is exactly where you want it to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I'm a fan of using the blindfold in a more realistic way, as much as Second Life allows, while still keeping it enjoyable for the mare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this I prefer to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="">Anavision</a>, as it gives immense control over the mare's vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is a list of the various settings I prefer to use and when to use them.
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet">
                    <li>When stalled, opaque</li>
                    <li>When carting, unblinded unless we're doing blind carting, then opaque</li>
                    <li>Whip circle, medium to thin</li>
                    <li>Traverse, unblinded</li>
                    <li>Flower, medium to thin</li>
                    <li>Hanging around, medium to thin</li>
                    <li>Intimate chilling, as tight as possible where they still can see the trainer</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="topic" id="reins">
                <h2>Reins</h2>
                <p>
                    The use of reins is something I think is very important, it reinforces that their place is by the trainer's side, or in their stall, and that their enrichment is dependent on the trainer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only times a mare may be off the reins is for example when doing flower dressage or silent dressage, otherwise they should be on a lead that is appropriate.
                    Personally I prefer a 5 meter long lead, as this forces the mare to be present at all times while walking, rather than being some plushie the trainer drags around half-AFK.<a href="#footnote-leash">2</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though having a pony heel and follow without a lead is nice for the trainer, it undermines the experience for the mare, and I'd discourage doing so.
                </p>

            <section class="topic" id="restrictions">
                <h2>Restrictions</h2>
                <p>
                    A key part of a mare's life is the loss of all agency and control, that includes things like being able to choose what to wear, read notecards, work on scripts, etc.
                    To deliver on this, leverage many if not most of the RLV restrictions available in whatever system you have available to you, but be cognizant that there can be cases where those restrictions have to be lifted,
                    so the method should allow other trainers to undo the restrictions if needed.
                    Here's a short list of restrictions I prefer to use;
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet">
